   "The thing is ${message.author}, you won’t find anything that brings you peace. You can look far and wide. Every site, open every tab.\nYou’ll only find peace when you search for Allah. Verily with the remembrance of Allah do hearts find peace.\n\n<@&1235619349084114983>",
    "${message.author} Just breathe deeply. Don't panic—just allow those thoughts to pass. These thoughts come and go... So, there's no need to feel frustrated or panicky. Those emotions often drive relapses. Relax, urges come to everyone, but they go if you stick it out. Breathe and allow them to pass.\n\n<@&1235619349084114983>",
    "The thing is ${message.author}, your dopamine receptors can’t really make you do anything unless you allow them to in a sense. It’s really just an idea.\n\nSo say no. \n\n<@&1235619349084114983>",
    "${message.author} \n\nProve that\n- you prefer Allah's pleasure over your own pleasure\n- you prefer the women of jannah over the women of this world\n- you prefer pain in obeying Allah over the pleasure of disobeying him\n\n<@&1235619349084114983>",
    "${message.author} \n\nBreathe and understand what is happening. Your addiction is being removed from you and it doesn't want to go. It's halfway out. And it wants to settle itself back inside you by shouting at you to entice you and seduce you.\n\nYou made it this far.\n\nDon't ruin it all now.\n\nLove: Hogan\n\n<@&1235619349084114983>",

    "Akhi ${message.author}, just think about this. Every sin slowly leads one to kufr.\n\nImagine staying in Jahannam forever.\n\nSurah Muminun 108: He (Allah) will say: 'Remain you in it with ignominy! And speak you not to Me!'\n\nDo you really want to hear Allah saying this to you? Is it worth to walk in the path which leads to this?\n\n<@&1235619349084114983>",

    "Don't give up ${message.author}! Remember that Allah is watching you and the angels are recording every action you make so do not fall for the plot of Iblis!\n\n<@&1235619349084114983>",
    "Oppose your desires ${message.author}! Ibn al-Qayyim (رحمه الله) said, 'Medicine for the heart is to oppose whims and desires and that is the most difficult matter upon the soul and there is nothing more beneficial for it than this.' [Ighātha al-Lahafān, 1/69]\n\nLeave this filthy sin for an increase in imaan my dear sister ${message.author}. Allaah will aid you if you leave it off for his sake.\n\n<@&1235619349084114983>",
    "Yes, I know it's difficult for you. But you must remember that Allah does not burden a soul beyond that it can bear.\n\nDon't let yourself be drained by sin and pure evil. You can resist it sis, you can still fight.\n\n\"Do not go gentle into that good night, Old age should burn and rave at close of day; Rage, rage against the dying of the light\"\n\n<@&1235619349084114983>",
    "Ibn Al-Qayyim رحمه الله said:\n\n“To restrain oneself from fulfilling unlawful desires is easier than to endure that which is the result of doing so, because giving in to one's desires will either cause pain and punishment or it will prevent a more perfect pleasure than could ever be experienced in this worldly life.”\n\n[al-Fawaa'id | P.235]\n\nSo overcome it sister for the sake of Allah, there is no gain only pain and deprivation of imaan!\n\n<@&1235619349084114983>",
    "Sister ${message.author},\n\nI know your real self is in there somewhere, and I know you don't want to do this. I know what you're feeling seems strong. But the fact is that this urge is actually very small and weak, and it's trying to trick you into thinking that this is a big deal and you need to act on it now!\n\nYou know in children's TV shows how a tiny harmless object can create a large scary shadow? But the lesson learned is that what we fear isn't always that scary when we confront it. That is what is happening right now!!! That tiny weak urge is trying to brainwash you into giving into your fears, falling, and ruining everything.\n\nRUN NOW BEFORE IT IS TOO LATE!!!\n\n<@&1235619349084114983>",

    "Sister ${message.author},\n\nTake these words very seriously. Repeat this to yourself right now: I'm being brainwashed, I'm being brainwashed, I'm being brainwashed.\n\nThis is not who I am and I'm not going to let something else control me.\n\n<@&1235619349084114983>",
    "You are stronger than your urges. You are **YOU**. Your urge is something else completely separate from you. Just because you feel it does not mean you have to act on it. Because you **ARE** that strong. Your urge can go on and do its own thing, You stay right there and hold firm.\n\nMake the effort.\n\n<@&1235619349084114983>",
    "Abu Bakr RA mentioned, a man wakes up surrounded by family while death is closer to him than his shoelaces.\n\nSo you ${message.author} have so little time to do good and avoid evil.\n\n<@&1235619349084114983>",
    "The few years we have on this earth is nothing in comparison to eternity in the garden and we've only been granted one chance to pass this. \n\nWe need to repent from sin before we lose this chance.\n\nLet's not wake up on the final day wailing 'if only Allah guided me!'\n\n<@&1235619349084114983>",
    "Allah sees everything ${message.author}\n\nDon't destroy your day/life for some minutes of \"pleasure\".\n\nGet up, walk, do something, anything, run like Yusuf AS!!!\n\nYou have to choose between the pain of discipline and the pain of relapsing. Not having pain is impossible.\n\nIt's your decision.\n\n<@&1235619349084114983>",
    "${message.author} \n\nThe surveillance of Allah is eternal, while the dirty pleasure is mere seconds that leaves you with guilt and sins. \n\nDo you want Allah to see you had this chance to repent and you threw it away?\n\n<@&1235619349084114983>",

    "Dear believer,\n\nRemember that your body is a trust from Allah, and your soul is precious. Your worth is not defined by these desires.\n\nSeek refuge in Allah from the whispers of Shaytan, and find comfort in the Quran and prayer.\n\nYou are stronger than your temptations, and your faith can overcome any struggle.\n\nKeep your gaze pure, your heart clean, and your soul nourished with the remembrance of Allah.\n\nRepent, seek forgiveness, Allah's mercy is boundless, and His love for you is infinite. \n\n<@&1235619349084114983>",
    "Your soul is a garden, and Allah's words are the water that nourishes it. Don't let the weeds of temptation choke out the beauty of your faith. Keep your heart hydrated with the Quran, and your spirit will flourish like a fragrant rose.\n\nRemember, every step away from temptation is a step closer to Allah's mercy and love. Keep walking, dear one, and know that Jannah awaits you. \n\n<@&1235619349084114983>"
